## gps_odom

gps_odom accepts position and velocity (from GPS), height (from altimeter), and orientation (from IMU). At the output it generates a world-frame odometry message, suitable for use in a kalman filter, etc.

Orientation is corrected by magnetic declination to geographic north. Odometry in meters is generated by setting a GPS reference point and calculating the local cartesian coordinates.

All geographical corrections are provided by [GeographicLib](http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net).

Depends on [kr_viz](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/kr_utils) for rviz messages.

### Input topics:

- `fix`: instance of `sensor_msgs\NavSatFix`.
- `fix_velocity`: instance of `geometry_msgs\TwistWithCovarianceStamped`. Angular velocity is ignored.
- `imu`: instance of `sensor_msgs\Imu`. Only orientation component is used.
- `pressure_height`: instance of `pressure_altimeter\Height`.
